# vehicle-emissions-predictor
My first, genuine machine learning project.  Built primarily with scikit-learn, an end-to-end preprocessing and modeling pipeline. Predicts vehicle CO2 emissions from specs like engine size and transmission. Achieved 97.3% R² on test data using a Random Forest Regressor.
